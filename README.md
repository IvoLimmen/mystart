# MyStart

My personal start/home page. I have been using Google Bookmarks for a long time. I also use multiple browsers. They all
have nice bookmark systems. But there is no tool that combines all my bookmarks. Yes there are plugins for browsers that
make your bookmarks available everywhere but they all lack something.

Short: I want to try it my way.

# Storage

 * Serialize (per user) to file
 * Storage in PostgreSQL (table creation script is included)

# What for features will come in the future?
 
 * Properties user/password for database.
 * Settings in general (serialize? database?)
 * Import of Delicious bookmarks.
 * Exports (?)
 * Configure browser.
 * Searching on fields using 'sounds like'.
 * Import Microsoft Shortcuts (favorites).
 * Configuration file for HTTP/HTTPS and other settings.
